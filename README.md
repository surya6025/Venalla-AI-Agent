# VENALLA GOD-LEVEL AI AGENT

**Omnipotent Desktop AI with Auto-Error Rectification**

## Overview

Venalla is a god-level AI agent system designed to provide omnipotent control over your digital world. This sophisticated AI system combines multi-agent orchestration, a plugin ecosystem, desktop integration, and voice pipeline for natural interaction.

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Unlimited agent parallelism with master orchestrator
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: VS Code-style extensibility with dynamic loading and hot-reload
- **Desktop Integration**: Full OS control (files, apps, system commands, automation)
- **Voice Pipeline**: Live speech-to-text, text-to-speech, wake word detection
- **Auto-Error Rectification**: Self-healing system that automatically diagnoses and fixes errors

### Advanced Features
- **LLM Integration**: Switch between Ollama/GPT/Claude/Gemini instantly
- **Memory Engine**: Long-term memory with vector embeddings and context retention
- **Workflow Engine**: Multi-step task orchestration with state machine
- **Security Manager**: Encrypted credentials and permission system
- **Event Reflector**: Live audit log of all agent actions
- **Self-Updater**: Automatic system code and plugin updates

## Architecture

The system consists of 15+ core modules:

1. **main.py** - Bootstrap with bulletproof error handling
2. **main_window.py** - Full PyQt6 multi-panel UI
3. **agent_core.py** - Master orchestrator with unlimited agent spawning
4. **plugin_manager.py** - Dynamic loading, hot-reload, auto-update
5. **llm_manager.py** - Multi-LLM switching
6. **voice_pipeline.py** - Complete voice interface
7. **desktop_controller.py** - Full OS control
8. **workflow_engine.py** - Task orchestration
9. **device_bridge.py** - Network devices, IoT, cloud sync
10. **memory_engine.py** - Vector-based long-term memory
11. **self_updater.py** - Auto-update system
12. **security_manager.py** - Encrypted credentials
13. **event_reflector.py** - Live audit log
14. **emotion_engine.py** - Personality adaptation
15. **advanced_automation.py** - Computer vision, web scraping, RPA
